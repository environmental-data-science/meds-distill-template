If you're familiar with markdown, use standard syntax to update font styles, add bulleted lists, subscripts/superscripts, etc. (or learn more from the [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/im-luka/markdown-cheatsheet)).

## IDE Visual Editors

Both [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) and Visual Studio Code ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)) are powerful tools that support Markdown editing with features that enhance visual editing and provide a more user-friendly experience. Hereâ€™s how you can use these environments effectively for Markdown editing:

### RStudio

RStudio is particularly well-suited for Markdown editing. Here's how to use it:

1. **Open/Create a Markdown File**:
   - Start RStudio and either open an existing Markdown file or create a new one by going to **File > New File > R Markdown**.

2. **Edit and Write Markdown**:
   - You can write standard Markdown for use in this template; `mkdocs` cannot parse RMarkdown documents that contain R code blocks. RStudio's editor supports syntax highlighting for Markdown and R code, making it easier to distinguish text from code (again, don't try to use R code on pages for this template).

3. **Use the RStudio Toolbar**:
   - RStudio includes a Markdown toolbar that provides buttons for common formatting options like headers, bold, italics, bullet lists, and more. This toolbar simplifies formatting without needing to remember Markdown syntax.

4. **Live Preview**:
   - Use the **Knit** button (the yarn ball icon) in RStudio to compile your Markdown document into a HTML, PDF, or Word document. This action also provides a preview of how your document will look.
   - For plain Markdown files, you can use the **Preview** button (next to the Knit button) to see a live HTML preview of your document.


### Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

VSCode, a lightweight but powerful source code editor, supports Markdown editing through its built-in features and extensive extension ecosystem:

1. **Install Markdown Extensions**:
   - Open the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar, or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Install extensions such as **Markdown All in One** by Yu Zhang for enhanced Markdown support (like table formatting, list editing, and more) and **Markdown Preview Enhanced** by Yiyi Wang for a powerful preview feature.

2. **Open/Create a Markdown File**:
   - Open an existing Markdown file or create a new one with a `.md` extension. VSCode recognizes the file type and enables Markdown-specific features.

3. **Edit and Preview Markdown**:
   - Write your Markdown content in the editor. With the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension, you can open a side-by-side preview by clicking on the preview icon in the top right of the editor or by pressing `Ctrl+K V`. This live preview updates as you edit the Markdown file.

4. **Use Markdown Shortcuts and Commands**:
   - VSCode supports various Markdown shortcuts and commands which can be accessed via `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette and typing `Markdown`. You'll find commands for styling, navigating, and managing Markdown content.

5. **Customize Your Experience**:
   - Customize the Markdown preview styles by modifying the VSCode settings or adding custom CSS styles for the preview.
